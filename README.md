## Overview

In today’s digital age, marketing accounts (commonly known as "marketing videos") flood social media platforms with content that often contains exaggerated claims or outright falsehoods. These accounts thrive on driving traffic, manipulating emotions, and misleading audiences for commercial gain. **TrustGuard** addresses this issue by providing users with an easy-to-use tool to validate the authenticity of the content they consume, focusing specifically on marketing videos.

## Features

- **Content Identification**: Identifies content from marketing accounts by analyzing video features such as titles, language, and visual cues.
- **Source Verification**: Verifies the origins of claims made within marketing videos by cross-referencing with reliable and authoritative sources.
- **Credibility Score**: Provides a credibility score based on the accuracy of the video’s claims and the reliability of its sources.
- **Multimedia Analysis**: Uses computer vision and text extraction to analyze video images and audio content, flagging potentially misleading or fraudulent claims.
- **Transparency**: Outputs detailed references and citation links, helping users trace back to original sources of the information.

## How It Works

1. **Content Scraping**: We gather video metadata, including titles, descriptions, and textual information from subtitles and captions.
2. **Textual Analysis**: The system scans the script and visual components for common patterns found in marketing content, such as sensational language or misleading claims.
3. **Source Cross-Referencing**: Using advanced algorithms, we check if the claims made in the video are supported by verified sources, such as trusted news outlets, academic papers, or governmental publications.
4. **Report Generation**: The result is a clear and concise report, providing the user with a credibility score, sources of truth, and suggestions for further verification.
